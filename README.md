# Traditional Dice Baseball Game
This is a demo for a new tabletop baseball game that hardens back to a more traditional game.

In this demo you'll get 4 complete teams from the 1986 season: New York Yankees, Texas Rangers, St. Louis Cardinals, and San Diego Padres. There are no pitcher hitter cards so you'll need to use a DH.

Please note, this is only a four team demo to try the first prototype. It is not a game in production. When you print these cards it is best to use paper, not cardstock. The game is subject to change and this is not a production version.
